This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

    ● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
    ● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
    ● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

        • In conclusion, we conclude that sending the message does not significantly affect the patient's attendance.

        • But the patient's location greatly affects the percentage of his attendance with the arrival of the message.

        • The effect of age was evident in a large percentage from the age of 0 to 8 years because of the parents' interest in them, and with increasing age, attendance decreased

        • Other characteristics such as sex or alcohol are not considered factors affecting whether a person attends or not!"Tips" like this one so that the presentation is as polished as possible.
